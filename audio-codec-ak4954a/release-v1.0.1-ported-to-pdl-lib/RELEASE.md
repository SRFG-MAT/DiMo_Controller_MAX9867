# Light Sensor Release Notes

This library provides functions to support use of the AK4954A audio codec found on the CY8CKIT-028-TFT shield.

REMARK (2022 / DiMo Project):
(a) THIS DEMO-CODE (for the audio-chip "AK4954A") is originally based on the following similar "PSoC 62"-based example:
"CY8CKIT-062-BLE" --> Examples --> Peripherals --> "I2S Audio" see also: https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-i2s/blob/master/README.md

(b) However, in this code-example the underlying low-level libs I2S/I2C have been ported, so that the code is now using the *PDL*-based libraries (=configured by Modus-Toolbox GUI-"Device Configurator")
instead of the I2S *HAL*-library used in the original example (less recommended when targeting easier portable code for development-projects)

GENERAL WARNING: Please *avoid* using/sharing the same HW-PIN-resources (here I2C-Master + I2S) in a mixed-setting with other *HAL*-based code-examples, this would collide (only share the same HW-ressources with PDL-based code libraries)

IMPORTANT Remark: Currently the code only works when audio-chip is correctly connected, this proof-of-concept demo-code doesn't have perfect error-handling (see "//xxxx TODO" below)
